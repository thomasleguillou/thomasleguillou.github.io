Hi ! 

My name is _Thomas Le Guillou_.

I am an eager embedded software engineer and have a strong interest in software design and teamwork. My goal with this blog is to step back about my job, software engineer.


### Define my work

To me the most efficient way to illustrate the way I work is to select three words to explain what matters in my job :
      
1. #### Curious
I love to better understand the world. Not the opposite of being pragmatic !
	
2. #### SOLID principles
This anagram seems to me the best way to summarize what matters in a software design. <a class="btn btn-default" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29" role="button">Go to definition &raquo;</a>

3. #### Craftsmanship
"Software craftmanship movement" better summarizes values needed to be a professional programmer.
