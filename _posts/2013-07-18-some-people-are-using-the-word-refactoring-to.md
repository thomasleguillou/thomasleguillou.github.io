“Some people are using the word “refactoring” to describe significant work, say, weeks or even months of effort of rework. Sorry, I call that redesign.” Johanna Rothman—I read this article last year, when I just started to doubt about our work and the way we communicate to the world. It helped me identify the root cause problem and be sure of that. When it’s hard to change something in the source code, just say there is a design problem. Call that redesign, because the first design was not well think. Don’t call your work “refactoring”. The world will understand this as a “not really important” action, but it is.
