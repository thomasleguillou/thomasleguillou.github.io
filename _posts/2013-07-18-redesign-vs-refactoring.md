I read [this article](http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/03/refactoring-and-redesign-are-different.html) last year, when I doubted about the way my team communicated it to the world.

#####If it’s hard ad reliable features in the source code, just say clearly there is a design problem. Call that redesign, because the first design was not well think, and not adapted enough for evolution. 
Don’t call your work “refactoring”. The world will understand this as a “not really important” action or a not really valuable task, but it really is.
