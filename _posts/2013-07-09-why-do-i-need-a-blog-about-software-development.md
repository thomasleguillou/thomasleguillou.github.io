I have three goals :
improve my web visibility. I need to present the way I’m working, my ideas and where I am in my understanding of software development
try to answer questions on which the answers I found on the Internet doesn’t satisfy me.
want to step back from situations that I encountered.
Actually something is scaring me with this tool :
my ideas could (and will) evolve. I will probably regret some article I wrote.
So anyway, I want to test that, I want to write articles during 6 month, and see if something fun occurs !

Let’s start !
